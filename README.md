MAKO AI: An open-source, decentralized protocol for autonomous software development. Our smart contracts on Polygon orchestrate AI agents to create, test, and deploy code. The system is powered by the $KOAI utility token for staking, rewards, and governance. This repo contains the core protocol. Welcome, builders.
