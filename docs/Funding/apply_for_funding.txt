Step 1. Prioritize Targets

Here’s a shortlist of programs that fit your situation best:

✅ Low-friction, high-fit

OpenAI – People-First AI Fund
Apps open now, close Oct 8, 2025. Unrestricted funding for nonprofits/mission-driven AI. If you don’t have a nonprofit set up, you can apply with a fiscal sponsor.

AI Grant (microgrants, $5k–$50k)
Simple app, no-strings-attached, great for open-source projects like MAKO.

🚀 Accelerators (fast track for solo founders)

a16z SPEEDRUN (SR006)
Apps close Sept 28, 2025; invests up to $1M in seed funding.

Y Combinator (Winter 2026 batch apps open now)
Rolling applications, YC has said solo AI founders are viable.

🏛️ Government (slower, larger, more paperwork)

NSF SBIR Phase I (America’s Seed Fund)
~$275k Phase I; U.S. small business eligibility. Great if you want to register MAKO as an LLC.

DoD AFWERX Open Topic
Next cycle opens Apr 23, 2025 → closes May 21. Needs “dual-use” framing (civil + defense).

DOE Office of Science FOAs
For AI in science/energy; may be a stretch fit but worth tracking.

🌐 Web3 / Decentralized

SingularityNET DeepFunding / ASI Alliance Grants
Milestone-based, up to $100k; good fit if you pitch MAKO as decentralized/open.

Step 2. Prep a Reusable Application Packet

Most applications want the same core pieces:

Executive Summary (1–2 pages) → Problem, Solution (MAKO), Impact.

Technical Plan → What’s novel about your architecture (agents, offline-first, ownership).

Team → You as founder + MAKO “agents” as framework.

Budget → Clear breakdown (like we did for GoFundMe).

Impact → Education, access, community empowerment.

Milestones → 6–12 month deliverables (MVP, pilots, documentation).

Once we write this once, you can reuse + adapt it across programs.

Step 3. Decide Sequence

I’d suggest:

OpenAI People-First Fund (due Oct 8 → urgent).

AI Grant (rolling; quick win possible).

a16z SPEEDRUN (due Sept 28 → big accelerator shot).

YC (submit now, keep refining).

Government (NSF SBIR Phase I → set up LLC first).
